**Real estate price prediction** is the process of using data and machine learning algorithms to predict the future value of a property. The goal is to provide an accurate estimate of a property's value, which can be useful for various stakeholders,

1. Developed a machine learning model to predict property prices based on various features
2. Explored and cleaned the dataset, handling missing values and outliers
3. Applied feature engineering techniques, including log transformation and label encoding
4. Selected the most relevant features using Lasso regression
